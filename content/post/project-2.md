title: "Project 2: Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets"
---

For this example project I built a NLP model to identify the tweet is disasters or not.

This is new to me and I like to deploy it by doing this dataset. In this some visualization, tokenization, CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer and Machine Learning model LogisticRegression where used.
